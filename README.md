I was always interested in computers as a kid, which led me to pursue a BS in CS at University of Illinois Chicago. I love doing open source software development, as I find other people potentially using my code to be a great motivator to make quality, maintainable code. Any project that has any part I think could be of use to someone, I always publish. 

I am currently improving my Java skills and starting to learn AWS and other cloud platforms.

When I graduate in December of 2024, I am looking to bring my software development skills in to a fast-paced company that prioritizes innovation as a SWE full-time.
